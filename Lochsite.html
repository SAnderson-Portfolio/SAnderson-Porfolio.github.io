                    Lochsite is a prototype created as part of my professional project module for our client The Scottish Crannog Centre. Working as part of a team of eight and using an agile development methodology the project was created to match the brief provided by the client.
                    I was lead programmer on this project and the target platform was Android.

                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of prototyping was done for this project, the plan was to have various quick sections to show off different artefacts or aspects of archaeology.
                    The design process involved me coming up with different ideas to showcase these aspects which I could present to the team. Below is a collection of some of the videos I created to showcase these to the team and our supervisors.
                    Most at a very early stage as to not waste development time if the team did not want to proceed with the ideas but as you can see, a lot of my input through prototyping is reflected in the final product.
                    <br />
                    I created a lot of concepts for different artefacts that the Scottish Crannog Centre housed in their museum but unfortunately, a lot of them were not picked for the final product.
                    My favourite concepts were for the dredge hose which is a piece of underwater archaeology equipment and the coracle, an old kind of boat. Neither of these items were considered interesting enough to be included by the team when the final choices were made.
                    I felt that if these two concepts were further produced that they would have provided a fun gameplay experience for the user.

                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first project created in C# and Unity, learning what I can about a new language and development environment is always an exciting experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a great learning experience, I'd never had to create an accurate representation of real life aspects in my projects before. I could usually do whatever I pleased; space shooters, time travelling remotes, or even a worm searching for their shadow.
                    Researching ancient history and modern underwater archaeological techniques was fascinating and working out how to create accurate gameplay representations of these that would interest the target audiences was great.
                    Visiting the centre itself was an invaluable experience to help with research.
